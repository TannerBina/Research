# Research

This file contains all details, codes, presentations and reports about the research done by me and my team at University of Richmond on
the Traveling Salesman Problem and its variations. The code current contains testing programs, visualization programs, and the designed
algorithm. Alongside the code is a presentation prepared for my peers and professors at the university of Richmond as well as technical
write ups of our project at different states.
