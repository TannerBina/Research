# Research

This file contains all details, codes, presentations and reports about the research done by me and my team at University of Richmond on
the Traveling Salesman Problem and its variations. The code current contains testing programs, visualization programs, and the designed
algorithm. Alongside the code is a presentation prepared for my peers and professors at the university of Richmond as well as technical
write ups of our project at different states.

The code folder contains all code for the TBCP algorithm to run and determine a result as well as the branch and bound algorithm. Alongside
this code, there is also code for displaying routes and running automated tests.

The documents folder contains write ups of the current state of research as well as prepared presentations updated to the current state of 
the research.

The data folder contains our main data harvested from different tests run using our code.

The point set folder contains all point sets used in our tests as well as their best known TSP solutions.
